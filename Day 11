ðŸ“ŒTopic:- Reverse Words in a String
QuestionLink:- https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/
ðŸ“ŒDescription:- Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
ðŸ“ŒTestcase 1:-
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
ðŸ“ŒTestcase 2:-
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
ðŸ“ŒTestcase 3:-
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
ðŸ“ŒConstraints:-
1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
ðŸ“ŒCode:-

var reverseWords = function(s) {    
    let reverse = '';
    let words = s.split(' ');
    
    for( let i = words.length-1; i >= 0; i-- ) {
         if( words[i] == '' ) {
             continue;
         } 
         reverse += words[i] + ' ';               
    }
    
    return reverse.trim();
};
